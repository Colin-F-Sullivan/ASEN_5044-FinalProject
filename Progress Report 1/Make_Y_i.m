% Purpose: Create the vector of y_i measurements for some given station 'i'
%          over some time vector 't' with corresponding state information
%          'state'. Additionally the script takes into account the viewing
%          angle information and ensure that the tracking station can only
%          record non-zero information if the spacecraft is in its FOV
%
% Inputs:  i     = Station Number of Y_i that should be generated
%          t     = Some vector of times that this should be calculated over
%          state = state vector X of the spacecraft over the time vector t
%
% Outputs: y_i_out   = y_i_out as defined in the project document
