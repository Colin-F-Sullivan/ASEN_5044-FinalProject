% Purpose: Generate the current Ctilde Matrix, given State Vector and
%          current time t. Calculates Tracking Station Locations first,
%          then checks for valid observation angle. Only outputs Ctilde for
%          valid (Observing) Tracking Stations.
%
% Inputs: Current Time - t
%         State Vector - StateVector
% Outputs: Current Ctilde Matrix (scaled as appropriate for number of 
%          available tracking stations that can see Sat) - Ctilde
%          List of Valid (Observing) Stations by Number - ObservingStations
