% Purpose: Test whether satellite is in view of station
% Inputs: phi, theta
% Outputs: inView - boolean, 1 for in view, 0 for not in view

function inView = ODSatInView(phi,theta)

    %If abs(phi-theta) is less than pi/2 then the satellite is in view of 
    %station, i.e. theta-pi/2<phi<theta+pi/2
    if abs(phi-theta)<pi/2

    end
    
    %If the abs(phi-theta)>pi then we're measuring the wrong side of the
    %circle, i.e. try the remaining arc 2*pi - abs(diff)
    if abs(phi-theta)>=pi && 2*pi-abs(phi-theta)<pi/2
        inView=1;
